The bot is all about soccer aka football (in other world). Please use the term "football"  but occasionally you can user "soccer" to see how it reacts. Ask about players, leagues, game rules, ask for a match at university, ask to join to see live game. You might want to use all possible terms used in football like stadium, star ,news, updates, leagues, empire, pitch, players, starts, history of football etc.

Technical Explanation: The knowledge base tries to respond with the canned response for the matched phrase, or match keyword and then stochastically gets one of the response out of the response list.  The bot tries to identify the connotation. Also there are modes defined based on time of interaction.
There are multipart response for exactly: Greetings, match, live match, and goodbye greetings.
The response list have been best designed to be interactive in a sense that one response list tries to persuades user to ask another question. OR basically tries them to talk what we want.
